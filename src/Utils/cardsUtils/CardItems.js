    story: `Fortunately for me I met Ireti first during our service year(2019), our camp in Iseyin, Oyo state.
     Ireti and our other friend Jennifer were always teasing one of the soldiers in the camp, they were funny tsha..Fast forward to when we finished camp and were posted to Ibadan north LGA. We got to our LGA and I saw Ireti and Jennifer and I was glad to see a familiar face, I tsha dropped a message for her tsha and we started talking,
     little did I know that was the begining of a relationship I cherish now and today¬†and¬†tomorrow.
     Anyways, after we resumed in January to our various PPA and Ireti had already settled into her self contain apartment, I decided to pay a visit after our General CDS one day, That's the day I met Solomon (Black guy, darker than his shadow). A very funny lad tsha, it was easy to be friends with Solomon because of his positive vibe and funny personality. The guy did waste time to invite me to Church the second day
      I came to visit them(Ireti and Solomon were already a couple).That's how we 
      became friends all three of us and men its been a fun ride all¬†these¬†years.

    story: `About the Bride (Olabisi):
    Sis Olabisi, the beautiful lady with the charmingly tiny voice, has always been a picture of grace and elegance. She‚Äôs the kind of person you instantly notice in church, and her calm and collected nature is truly admirable. Thank you, Olabisi, for your initial ‚Äúshakara‚Äù before saying yes to my wonderful egbon (brother).
    
    About the Groom (Mr. Akin):
    Mr. Akin, on the other hand, surprised me with his warmth and sense of humor. My first impression was that he was a quiet man, but boy, was I wrong! Our first conversation after a church service revealed a supportive and fun-loving side to him. He occasionally teases me, but beneath it all, I see a true gentleman. Plus, Mr. Akin‚Äôs knowledge knows no bounds ‚Äì he‚Äôs the bookworm of the duo. It‚Äôs an absolute privilege to be your hype woman, Mr Akin!
    
    How They Met and Love Story:
    Their love story is a testament to the unpredictable and beautiful nature of life‚Äôs twists and turns. When they first crossed paths in church, Sis Olabisi was a picture of grace and independence, content in her own world. She had no intentions of diving into a romantic relationship, and I distinctly remember her initial hesitation.
    
    But, love has its own plans. My brother would not have it üòÇüòÇ, their paths continued to cross, and they found themselves drawn to each other in ways they never expected. Slowly but surely, their friendship deepened into a bond that neither could resist. It‚Äôs a love story that defies expectations and proves that sometimes, the heart knows best.
    
    Today, as we celebrate their union, we can‚Äôt help but be inspired by the love that grew against all odds, reminding us that true love is often found when we least expect it.
    
    As they embark on this journey as a married couple, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Sis Olabisi and Mr. Akin. I look forward with great anticipation to the amazing things that GOD will continue to do in the lives of this power couple and the beautiful family that‚Äôs about to be born. It only gets better from here.`,
