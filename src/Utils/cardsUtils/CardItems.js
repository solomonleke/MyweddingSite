    story: `Fortunately for me I met Ireti first during our service year(2019), our camp in Iseyin, Oyo state.
     Ireti and our other friend Jennifer were always teasing one of the soldiers in the camp, they were funny tsha..Fast forward to when we finished camp and were posted to Ibadan north LGA. We got to our LGA and I saw Ireti and Jennifer and I was glad to see a familiar face, I tsha dropped a message for her tsha and we started talking,
     little did I know that was the begining of a relationship I cherish now and today and tomorrow.
     Anyways, after we resumed in January to our various PPA and Ireti had already settled into her self contain apartment, I decided to pay a visit after our General CDS one day, That's the day I met Solomon (Black guy, darker than his shadow). A very funny lad tsha, it was easy to be friends with Solomon because of his positive vibe and funny personality. The guy did waste time to invite me to Church the second day
      I came to visit them(Ireti and Solomon were already a couple).That's how we 
      became friends all three of us and men its been a fun ride all these years.

    story: `So I’ve known Moyin Adeleke way back from secondary school days, tho we didn’t vibe until after secondary school.
    Hmm I already told moyin that I’d say this on his wedding day. Moyin bullied 💪me back in secondary school ooh infact one time he gave me a very dirty slap that I had blood in my eyes for 2weeks. I called that slap (Moyin Slap cos the slap was hefty). I know you all would want to know the story behind the slap. Well I’d continue the story on my wedding day, so if you want to know how the story went then come on my wedding day👨‍⚖👰🏻‍♀🤪.
    
    But immediately after secondary school we started vibing well infact Moyin was the last person that I’d think of getting close to especially after that (Moyin Slap)
    He has been someone who as always pushed me, he’d always be like guy come and do tech, tech is where the money is. Infact it got to a time he was begging me saying guy do please just go into tech, tech is the next way bro and truly that motivated me into tech now. All thanks to Moyin.
    I could say a lot about Moyin cos he’s a wonderful friend.  But I’d just say a few 
    Moyin Loves God
    Moyin Loves Iretioluwa(oh yes my guy is a one Man woman) since have known him to be in a relationship with ireti, moyin has never talked about another lady let alone seen with another lady, na man you be.
    Moyin is Passion Driven
    Moyin is Intelligent 
    Moyin is a Goal setter and Goal getter
    Moyin is Devoted
    Moyin is a Dedicated Man
    Moyin is a motivator 
    Moyin tells you if you’re wrong
    Ah yes Moyin loves Origin😂😂😂
    Moyin is one hell of a good driver, how can I even almost forget about this😂
    And finally he might not know this but I look up to him as My Mentor cos he portrays everything a Mentor should have. 
    (Because a Mentor is who knows the way and shows you the way) and this is exactly what My Brother here Mr Moyin Adeleke Portrays.
    
    CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎉🎊🎈 ON YOUR WEDDING. I wish you all the best of things that comes with marriage. May your home bring peace and be filled with love and wonderful children 
    Amen`,
