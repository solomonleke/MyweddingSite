                So, it all started after NYSC camp (I was meant to go and serve my father land o)
                I had just gotten to Ibadan and gotten a place but because I knew no one at that time ,I had to call a friend of mine who hadn't gotten a place but was staying over at a church apartment (mfm I think ðŸ¤”) .
                This particular day I went to visit this friend of mine Jennifer  at the church house and prior to that she'd been gisting me about a guy she met there and they were staying there together and she was so crazy about the guy and wanted me to meet him .
                so out of boredom (I mean new corper no  work ) I went to the family house and I  met with my friends crush , met quite a few people and I was just having a lovely afternoon .
                But there in the corner was this "guy" who kept making everybody laugh , was in everyone's face and you just couldn't miss him and I laughed,laughed and laughed , this guy just wouldn't stop ! .
                Fast forward to the next day I found myself there again (ahhhh) this time I didn't even go home to sleep ,then a particular thing happened we were to go hunting for food ,and then there came 2 bikes ,my friend had hopped on a bike with her guy ,then there I was left with this guy that had made me laugh all day,I refused to sit in between him and the bike guy ðŸ¤£  as a saint that I am , but what struck me was that unlike most guys he didn't make a fuss out of  it ,he gladly sat in the middle and there I was like oh what a gentleman .(ðŸ˜…)
                Fast-forward to the next day , I invited the trio to my place ( Jennifer her boo and "my boo" ðŸ¤­)and then this guy cooked ! A guy that cooks ! (I'm like oh em gee ðŸ˜®) meanwhile ,all along we had talked ,cos my friend was busy with his friend so we had to talk, and we were getting along in a weird way ,one way I hadn't gotten along with anybody before in the past . so , he cooked ,he was sweet , he made me laugh ,the way he talked about his life and the things he loved made me admire him, oh and he cooked ( trust me you can't imagine ) .
                One thing led to another and here we are 4 years after ! I can't wait toÂ sayÂ IÂ doÂ ðŸ¥°

                So it all started in my service year 2019.
                I was posted to Oyo state and i wanted to work my service to Ibadan ,
                I had plans to get a place before getting to Ibadan and I had given a cousin of mine money to get me a place  , On my arrival I
                got to know she hadn't gotten the place due to bank issues.Then I reached out to a close friend who had  camped in oyo state
                so I could stay with him while I sorted my accommodation issues ,He reached out to me and told me he was staying at a church family house as he had not gotten a place to stay.
                so I found myself at the church family house too , there I got to meet a lot of people , played and had a lot of fun , then on a very beautiful day this very fine  babe came around to see a friend in the family house
                I got to know she had a place and she just came to see her friend who was a friend of my friend . Long story short she had a very sweet sense of humour just like me , she made me laugh! She was nice to me , the next day She took us to her place and  we started drifting towards one another from that moment . I had no plans for a relationship at all , cos i had just left a toxic relationship
                but few weeks down the line i just discovered i was already seeing a future with this sweet babe, she had all the material any man would want  , all my attempt to not get in the feeling failed woefully , covid came and she had to go home and it was like a part of me was ripped away .
                That was when i knew ! a few months down the line , i jokingly asked if she would marry me and she said yes ! 4 years down and i cant wait to pay her bride price .
                I cant wait to spend the rest of my life with my NYSC baby !.
